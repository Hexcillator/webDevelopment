						<p>
							Doing research about the type of website style I would like use I found Marios Takoushis’s website.
						</P>
						<p>
						 	Then I tried to design something similar but without using its code, making my own layout from scratch.
						</p>
						<p>
							In order to achieve this, I started with a basic index.html page, indexing all text properly, using semantic elements, dividing parts (div), adding hyperlinks to my navigation bar and adding pictures. I used Lorem Ipsum to fill up text spaces before adding the actual content. 
						</p>  
						<p>
							After being more or less satisfied with the content of my index.html I did some basic CSS to position the objects the way I had planned to have them.
						</p>
						<p>
							From the beginning my intention was to create an interactive picture slide under the header section, and to achieve this, I downloaded a Jquery library, stored it as jquery.js in the Javascript folder and called it from the html head’s section. Then after some research I found a page were I downloaded a Jquery plugin called Cycle2 which I included in my Jquery file, and then controlled it from a separate js file which I called myjquery.js.
						</p>
						<p>
							To continue with my plan, I collected some of my favorites pictures and set them to be 80 by 55px in size and black and white, to create two rows of pictures that when clicked will display a Lightbox effect.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Lightbox file is a Javascript file that I found and downloaded from Lokesh Dhakar’s page, loaded into the js folder and I called its script tag just before the closing body tag to prevent it from delaying the page load. Lightbox is free to use for either commercial or non commercial work.
						</p>
						<p>
							To create my Twitter feeds section, I did an intensive research until I discovered that in the twitter’s page there is a tool that allow us to embed a customized timeline to our html and then we can apply CSS to it to set its position and size. 
						</p>
						<p>
							At the footer section I added a navigation bar, and animated CSS social media buttons.
						</p>
						<p>
							At this stage, the page is looking more or less like I wanted it to be, but I realized that maybe it would be a good idea to have a hover effect in text with hyperlinks (eg. Navigation bar), as well as pictures that are part of the Lightbox or Latest Collaborations to signal the user that they can click on them.
						</p>
						<p>
							To achieve this, I did some research until I found what I was looking for at the stackoverflow website. I tried different settings until I got the speed and the intensity of the opacity effect.
						</p>
						<p>
							From this point, I created the different pages that would take part in my portfolio and link them accordingly.
						</p>
						<p>
							In my contact page I set a google form and embedded it to my contact.html file. 
						</p>
						<p>
							One of the biggest and more time consuming tasks I faced with my website is to make it responsive with all the objects I have used in it. 
						</p>
						<p>
							As with the images, I have been setting their width to percentages and their height to auto and trying different paddings and margins, achieving a good response to resizing.
						</p>
						<p>
							With videos, it is a bit more complicated as their height cannot be set to auto, so instead I added additional settings after going through a website called CSS tricks and trying different examples until I got it right. 
						</P>
						<p>
							On top of that, I used a separated responsive CSS sheet from W3 schools, and tried implementing the ‘restive’ jquery plug in, but I could not make it work.

						</p>
						<p> I managed in the end to get acceptable results using CSS3 media queries, setting 3 different css pages according to the page size.
						</p>
